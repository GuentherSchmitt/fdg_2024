# fdg_2024

In 2024 <a href="https://fdg-ab.de/">Friedrich Dessauer Gymnasium</a> in Aschaffenburg organized a Flutter training for their high school students. 

All presentations shown and most of the code developed during the training are stored here in the repository fdg_2024. 

You can find a motivation for the training and the goals we wanted to reach in the following <a href="https://github.com/GuentherSchmitt/fdg_2024/blob/main/docs/01%20Why%20should%20I%20learn%20Flutter.pdf">presentation</a>, shown at the beginning of the training in October 2024.
